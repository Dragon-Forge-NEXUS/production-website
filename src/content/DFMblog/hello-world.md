### How the Site is Built and Hosted

Our site is powered by the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) and is currently hosted on [Cloudflare Pagesâ„¢](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). We want to emphasize that we are not affiliated with either party, but we highly recommend both services for their exceptional performance and reliability.
